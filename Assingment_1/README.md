1. Project Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to provide intelligent, context-aware answers regarding a public transportation monitoring system.

The core functionality revolves around processing specific documentation or knowledge bases related to bus transit operations—specifically focusing on real-time bus tracking, estimated arrival times (ETA), and passenger occupancy detection. By leveraging RAG, the system retrieves relevant chunks of information from these source documents to augment the responses of a language model, ensuring accuracy and grounding the answers in the provided data.

Key Capabilities:

Information Retrieval: semantically searches a knowledge base for relevant query context.

Contextual Answering: Answers user queries about specific transit metrics like "Bus location," "Passenger count," and "Seat availability."

Source Attribution: The system appears designed to reference specific information sources (e.g., "Source 1," "Source 2") to validate its answers.

2. Tools & Libraries Used
The project utilizes a modern Python-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) stack.

Development Environment:

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab: The primary interface for development, utilizing GPU acceleration (Tesla T4 detected) for efficient model inference.

Python 3: The underlying programming language.

Core Libraries:

sentence-transformers: Used for generating dense vector embeddings of the text data. The specific model identified is all-MiniLM-L6-v2, a highly efficient model optimized for semantic search and clustering.

transformers (Hugging Face): Provides the foundational architecture for loading and managing pre-trained language models.

huggingface-hub: Facilitates the downloading and management of model weights and configurations from the Hugging Face Hub.

Standard Python Libraries: Likely includes numpy or pandas for data handling (implied by standard data science workflows).

3. Instructions to Run the Notebook
Follow these steps to successfully execute the project code.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+ environment.

GPU Access (Recommended): While the code can run on a CPU, using a GPU (like in Google Colab) is significantly faster for generating embeddings.

Installation

If running locally, you must install the required dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal or a notebook cell:

Bash
pip install sentence-transformers transformers huggingface-hub
Execution Steps

Open the Notebook:
Load RAG_PROJECT-2.ipynb into Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or upload it to Google Colab.

Environment Setup:
Ensure your runtime type is set to GPU if available (in Colab: Runtime > Change runtime type > T4 GPU).

Run Cells Sequentially:

Import & Install: Execute the initial cells to install libraries and import necessary modules.

Model Loading: Allow the sentence-transformers model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to download. This may take a moment (approx. 90MB).

Data Ingestion: The subsequent cells likely define the source text (documents regarding bus tracking) and create embeddings.

Querying: Go to the final section of the notebook to input your questions (e.g., "How is passenger occupancy calculated?") and view the generated responses.

Troubleshooting:

Hugging Face Token Warning: You may see a warning about unauthenticated requests. This is generally harmless for public models like all-MiniLM-L6-v2, but setting a HF_TOKEN environment variable can resolve it if you hit rate limits.
